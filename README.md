**DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING**

-> Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic approach to solve some complex problems easily and save time and number of comparisons by storing the results of past computations. The basic idea of dynamic programming is to store the results of previous calculation and reuse it in future instead of recalculating them.

-> We can also see Dynamic Programming as dividing a particular problem into subproblems and then storing the result of these subproblems to calculate the result of the actual problem.

**STRING**
Strings are defined as a stream of characters. Strings are used to represent text and are generally represented by enclosing text within quotes.
